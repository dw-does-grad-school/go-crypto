# go-crypto
A lightweight command-line crypto tracking tool written in Go, built to explore the language’s core features — including concurrency, API interaction, and structured data handling. The project fetches and displays real-time cryptocurrency prices and market data from public APIs, demonstrating practical use of Go’s goroutines, channels, and JSON parsing.

Originally developed as a learning exercise to strengthen Go fundamentals, the app serves as a minimal yet functional reference for building performant data-driven CLI tools.
